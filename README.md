# Build Your Own Twitter Bots!

In this course we’ll learn how to create Twitter bots. We’ll first learn how to interface with the Twitter API using Twit.js, which allows us to post statuses, search tweets, and interact with followers. We’ll create several example bots that show the diversity of possibilities, using powerful tools such as RiTa.js, Google’s Cloud Vision API, Tracery, Natural.js, and the New York Times API. We’ll learn how to set up our bot to interface with Google Spreadsheets. We’ll also learn how to host our bot logic on Heroku and on Amazon.
